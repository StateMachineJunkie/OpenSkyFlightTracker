In my first cut of this API, use wrote my networking methods as asynchronous methods. I thought I could simply change the URL scheme and path to mock my API and get canned results when running unit-tests. I quickly learned that this is not as straigt-forward as it seemed.
So, instead I decided to use protocols in order to create a mock API object. Unfrotunately I cannot directly combine protocol methods with Swift Conccurrency (async-await). This meant that I would need to take a step back and add another layer. Not wanting to fall back to the tired (almost clech√©) closure based interface, I decided to use Combine(tm) instead.
