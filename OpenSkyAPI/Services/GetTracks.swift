// Get the trajectory for a given aircraft at a given time.
//
// The trajectory is a list of `Waypoint` values containing position, barometric altitude, true track and an on-
// ground flag.
//
// In contrast state vectors, trajectories do not contain all information we have about the flight, but rather show
// the aircraft's general movement pattern. For this reason, waypoints are selected among available state vectors
// given the following set of rules:
//
// * The first point is set immediately after the aircraft's expected departure, or after the network received the
// first position report when the aircraft entered its reception range.
// * The last point is set right before the aircraft's expected arrival, or the aircraft left the networks reception
// range.
// * There is a waypoint at least every 15 minutes when the aircraft is in-flight.
// * A waypoint is added if the aircraft changes its track more than 2.5ยบ
// * A waypoint is added if the aircraft changes altitude by more than 100 meters (~300 feet).
// * A waypoint is added if the on-ground state changes.
//
// - Parameters:
//   - transponder: An aircraft transponder. This is a unique ICAO24 value.
//   - time: Time in seconds since (Unix) epoch. It can be any time between the *start* and *end* of a known flight.
//           If **time = 0** (the default value), then get the live track if there is any flight ongoing for the given
//           aircraft.
// - Returns: A `Track` value, if available.
// - Note: The tracks endpoint is purely **experimental** and can be out-of-order at any time. You can use the
//         flights endpoint for historical data.
